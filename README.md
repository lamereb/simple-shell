## Simple Shell

### Super-simple shell to fulfill CS344 requirements.

In addition to forking/executing any command-line processes, this shell implements:
* 'cd' - to change directories
* 'status' - to see exit status of previous
* 'exit' - to exit back to bash prompt

'make' to compile, then './smallsh' to run.
